The early history of Audacity, through January 23, 2010

I'm one of the original authors of Audacity, the open-source audio editor.
In January 2010 the project switched from the CVS revision control system
to Subversion (losing history), and then later switched to Git
(preserving history).

This is a snapshot of the CVS archives of the project from the initial
checkin of Audacity 0.8 in June 2000 through January 23, 2010.
I converted it from CVS to Git using the cvs2svn/cvs2git tool.

A few things may have been mangled by this conversion. This is intended
more for historical analysis, not to actually grab the code and use it.
