<p><a href="..">Audacity</a> is a free audio editor for MacOS, Linux, and
Windows.  A group of volunteers is translating Audacity into several
languages.  If you would like to help, join the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-translation">
audacity-translation mailing list</a> and introduce yourself.</p>

<h2>About Localization</h2>

<p>The abbreviations <strong>I18N</strong> and <strong>L10N</strong> stand for
<em>internationalization</em> and <em>localization</em>.  The numerals refer
to the number of letters in the middle of each word.  Internationalization
allows a computer program to run in different languages and character sets.
Localization adds support for a particular language or locale.</p>

<p>We are localizing both the Audacity help files and the program itself.  We
use localization software to help translate the strings that appear inside the
application, including menus, buttons, and dialog boxes.  All of the user
visible strings are extracted from the Audacity source code and placed into a
"message catalog template" file called audacity.pot.  The localization software
allows you to translate the strings in this file.</p>

<p>These programs can create and edit PO files:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://poedit.sourceforge.net/">poEdit</a> for Windows and
    Unix.
  <li><a href="http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/">KBabel</a> for KDE.
  <li><a href="http://www.gtranslator.org/">gtranslator</a> for GNOME.
  <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU gettext</a> is
    standard on most Unix systems.  It includes a PO mode for the Emacs
    text editor.
  <li>I don't know of any PO editors for the Mac, but the author of poEdit is
    working on a version for MacOS X.
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Translation instructions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>First, you will need to download <a href="../beta.php">Audacity
  1.2</a>.
  Audacity 1.0 does not have support for translated messages.  This is
  a new feature in Audacity 1.2.

  <li><p>To start a new translation, download the latest audacity.pot file
  from the Resources section above.  Rename it audacity.po when you begin
  translating.  To contribute to an existing translation,
  <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/audacity/audacity-src/locale/">
  download the audacity.po file</a> for your language.</p>

  <li><p>When you have begun translating the PO file, use your translation
  program to compile a message catalog.  This will produce a file called
  <strong>audacity.mo</strong>.  In the same folder as the Audacity 1.2
  executable, create a folder whose name is the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/languages.html">
  two-letter code</a> for your language.  Place the MO file into this
  folder.</p>

  <li><p>Now, start the Audacity program.  From the File menu, open the
  Preferences window.  Go to the Interface tab and enter your two-letter
  language code.  You will need to close the Audacity application and start it
  again for this change to take effect.  After you do, it should load your
  message catalog and display your translated strings.</p>
</ul>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><p>In poEdit, make sure to set the "charset" option correctly.  Otherwise,
  poEdit will not save any translations with non-English characters.</p>

  <li><p>The string <strong>" window"</strong> in the audacity.po file does not
  refer to a window on the computer screen.  In this case it means a
  mathematical function with a "bell curve" shape, used in signal
  processing.</p>

  <li><p>Strings like <strong>"&amp;File"</strong> and <strong>"New &amp;Audio
    Track"</strong> are menu items.  The letter after the &amp; character is
  used as a keyboard shortcut on Windows and Unix.</p>

  <li><p><strong>"Import Audio...\tCtrl+i"</strong> is also a menu item.  The
  \t stands for a tab character, which separates the menu text from the
  keyboard command.</p>

  <li>You will find many strings like <strong>"There were %d buffer underruns,
    last near %lf seconds."</strong>  The % signs mark places where additional
  information will be inserted into the string.  For example, this string
  might become "There were 4 buffer underruns, last near 3.01 seconds." If you
  change the order of the the % markers in a string, add "1$" after the
  percent sign that used to be first, "2$" after the percent sign that used to
  be second, and so on.  For example:
  <blockquote><strong>"The buffer underrun near %2$lf seconds was the last of
      %1$d."</strong></blockquote>
</ul>
