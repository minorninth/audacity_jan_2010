<p>
Audacity was written by volunteers in their spare time.  It is not
shareware and nobody who works on it expects to make any money.
However, by making a monetary donation you can help us pay for
bandwidth and web hosting, development tools, and audio hardware -
things we need in order to continue to provide Audacity for free and
to continue to make it better.  Scroll to the bottom of this document
if you wish to make a credit card payment right now.  You can donate
as little as one dollar.
</p>
<p>
If you want to help out but can't afford to donate money, here are
many other suggestions on how you can help us out:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Tell us Hello!</b>
<p>
If you enjoy Audacity, tell us!  Send email to
<a href="mailto:audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net"
>audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
and let us know that you like it.  It makes us happy to know that
people enjoy it.  Also feel free to send us your comments and
suggestions - we're always improving Audacity, and we value your
input.
<p>

<li><b>Be a translator</b>
<p>
If you are fluent in both English and another language, you can help
out other people who speak your language.  We need people to translate
the program menus and dialogs, the documentation, and the website.
We also need people to join mailing lists for people to ask questions about
Audacity in their native language - you can help out either by answering
questions, or by translating the questions into English and posting them
to one of the English mailing lists.

<p>

<li><b>Report bugs</b>
<p>
If you find a bug in Audacity,
<a href="mailto:audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net"
>let us know</a>.
It is the most helpful if you take the time to reproduce the bug and
send us a detailed description of what you need to do in order to make
it happen.  Be sure to tell us what operating system you run (i.e.
Windows 2000, Mac OS 9, etc.).
<p>


<li><b>Be a beta-tester</b>
<p>
In addition to the latest stable version of Audacity, we always have
a beta version of Audacity.  This version usually contains many new
features that haven't been tested yet.  If you want to help out,
download this version of Audacity and play with it.  Let us know what
you like and what you don't like, and tell us how you think it should
be improved.  Be on the lookout for <i>regressions</i> - things that
used to work but don't work anymore.
<p>

<li><b>Be a developer</b>
<p>
If you are already an experience C++ programmer and you are comfortable
using tools such as CVS, we would love to have help developing Audacity.
Please download the latest source code from CVS and compile it, and then
introduce yourself on the
<a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-devel>
<?php print $develListStr; ?></a>.
<p>

<li><b>Donate money</b>
<p>
By sending us money, you can help us cover the costs of bandwidth,
development tools, and new audio hardware.  Note that right now,
we are lucky enough to have almost all of our hosting provided free of
charge, but this could change in the future.  Your dollars today will
keep this website up tomorrow.
<p>
The Audacity developers would like to purchase some high-end audio
hardware, so that we can start to turn Audacity into a complete
multitrack editing solution.  Your dollars will make it possible for
us to work on those features sooner.
<p>
Please understand that we do not provide you with any sort of guarantee
or promise when you give us money.
<p>
We currently accept money via the Amazon Honor System.  Use your credit
card and make a payment as small as one dollar, or up to $50.
<p>
If you wish to donate more than $50, or you wish to send a personal check,
please visit the
<?php print "<a href=credits.php?$langLinkStr>";
?>Credits</a> page and send an email to one or more of the individual
developers.
