If you're having a technical problem with Audacity, and it's too
specific to bother other Audacity users, send mail to this address.
It will be read by a team of Audacity developers and maintainers.
You should also use this address if you really need to contact the
Audacity developers directly for some other reason.
<p>
Audacity is being developed by volunteers all around the world.
Therefore, there is no phone number or mailing address where you can
reach us.  All Audacity development happens on the Internet, and 
the only way you can reach the developers is through one of these
mailing lists or email addresses.
