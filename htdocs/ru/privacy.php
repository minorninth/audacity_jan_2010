<p> If you are interested in receiving announcements whenever new
versions of Audacity are released, you are welcome to enter your email
address in the box on the left and click "Add".  You will be added to
our private mailing list, which we will only use to send brief,
infrequent announcements.
</p>

<!-- Translators - please add a sentence which explains that these
 announcements will usually be in English only.  Possibly people can
 join users lists in their native languages later on, to hear
 announcements there.

<p>
We value your privacy.
</p>

<p> At no time will the Audacity developers and/or maintainers of the
mailing list ever share the list with any third parties, for any
reason.  We will not store any other information about the users on
the list (not even your name!) and we will never post the mailing list
in a publicly accessible location.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please enter
your email address in the box to the left and press the "Remove" button.
This should remove you from our list immediately; no confirmation is
required and there will be no delay.  If for some reason it does not
work, please send email to dominic <b>at</b> minorninth.com and he will
try to help.
