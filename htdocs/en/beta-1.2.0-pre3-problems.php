<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<p>
The following are known bugs in Audacity 1.2.2:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Audacity can import and display MIDI files, but they cannot be played
    or edited.
    </p></li>
  <li><p>Linux:  Recording in full duplex (play existing tracks while
    recording) on some systems causes mono recordings to sound
    slowed-down.</p></li>
  <li><p>MacOS X: Audacity cannot work with files or folders that
    are contained inside folders with international characters
    (accent marks, etc.) in their names.  Note that files with
    accented characters work, and Audacity projects with
    accented characters work.  Only files inside of folders
    with accented characters in their names will cause problems.
    </p></li>
</ul>
