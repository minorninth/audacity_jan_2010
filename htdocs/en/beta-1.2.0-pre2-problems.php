<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<p>
The following are known bugs in Audacity 1.2.0-pre2:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audacity can import and display MIDI files, but they cannot be played
    or edited.
    <p>
  <li>Recording in full duplex (play existing tracks while recording) on some
    Linux systems causes the recording to sound slowed-down.
    <p>
  <li>MacOS X only: Audacity cannot work with files or folders that
    are contained inside folders with international characters
    (accent marks, etc.) in their names.  Note that files with
    accented characters work, and Audacity projects with
    accented characters work.  Only files inside of folders
    with accented characters in their names will cause problems.
    <p>

  <li>Windows only: Audacity is incompatible with some professional
    sound cards and may crash if one of these cards is the default
    when you open Audacity.  As a workaround, make a different
    sound card your default when using Audacity, but please let
    us know if this affects you so that we can track down and
    solve the problem.
    <p>
    Also note that the Windows installer will replace 1.0.0 installations, 
    but not the 1.1.x beta installations.
    <p>
