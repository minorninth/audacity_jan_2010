<p>
Audacity 1.2.0-pre4 is a public test release of the free Audacity sound
editor.  This version fixes many minor bugs found in Audacity 1.2.0-pre3.
This is a "release candidate" version.  If no new bugs are found, we will
release the new stable version 1.2.0 later this month.
</p>

<p>
Audacity 1.2.0-pre4 is available now for Windows and Linux.  A new release for
Mac OS X will be available after we fix some important bugs on that platform.
