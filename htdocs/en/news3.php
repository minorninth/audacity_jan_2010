<?php BoxTop('November 21, 2002: Version 1.1.1 update'); ?>

<p>
We are aware that there is a serious problem in version <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">1.1.1</b> (beta)
for Windows.  Selecting anything from a track pop-up menu will crash
the program.  We will be releasing version 1.1.2 for Windows only
within a few days to address this problem.  (This only affects the pop-up
menu in the track's label - all other menus function correctly - and
this only affects the Microsoft Windows version of Audacity <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">1.1.1</b>.)
</p>

<p>
For Unix users, a new source tarball has been released, <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">1.1.1</b>-3, which
fixes problems compiling with wxGTK 2.2.9.  We hope to have a version
which compiles on RedHat 8 with no modifications soon.
