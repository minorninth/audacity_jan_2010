<p>
Audacity 1.2.0-pre2 is a public test release of the free Audacity sound
editor.  This version fixes all of the known major bugs in 1.2.0-pre1,
and we anticipate very few changes between this version and the final
1.2.0 release in a few more weeks.  Everyone who is testing 1.2.0-pre1
or any previous beta version of Audacity (1.1.x) is encouraged to
upgrade immediately.

The <a href="beta.php?<?php print "$langLinkStr"; ?>">Beta Versions</a> page
has complete release notes and download links.
