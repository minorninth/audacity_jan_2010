Changes in 1.2.0:

  * New cross-fade effects.

  * Fix problem where samples were drawn in the wrong position
    when zoomed all the way in.  This caused the drawing tool
    to move a different sample than the one under the cursor.

  * Don't use id3v2.4 tags, which are not yet supported by
    most players.  (This was fixed in 1.2.0-pre2, but appeared
    again by accident in 1.2.0-pre3.)

  * Correctly display translated messages in the status bar.

  * When the cursor is on-screen, the Zoom In button now zooms
    to the area around the cursor.

  * Mac OS X: Fixed audio problems on the Apple PowerMac G5.

  * Linux/ALSA: Work around a bug in ALSA's OSS emulation that
    caused Audacity's playback cursor to move too quickly.

  * Microsoft Windows: The Audacity source code should now
    compile out of the box on Windows.

  * Many new/updated translations.
