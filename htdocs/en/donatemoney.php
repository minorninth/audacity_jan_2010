<p>
Audacity was written by volunteers in their spare time.  It is not
shareware and nobody who works on it expects to make any money.
However, by making a monetary donation you can help us pay for
bandwidth and web hosting, development tools, and audio hardware -
things we need in order to continue to provide Audacity for free and
to continue to make it better.  Scroll to the bottom of this document
if you wish to make a credit card payment right now.  You can donate
as little as one dollar.
</p>

<p>
By sending us money, you can help us cover the costs of bandwidth,
development tools, and new audio hardware.  Note that right now,
we are lucky enough to have almost all of our hosting provided free of
charge, but this could change in the future.  Your dollars today will
keep this website up tomorrow.
<p>
The Audacity developers would like to purchase some high-end audio
hardware, so that we can start to turn Audacity into a complete
multitrack editing solution.  Your dollars will make it possible for
us to work on those features sooner.
<p>
Please understand that we do not provide you with any sort of guarantee
or promise when you give us money.
<p>
We currently accept money via the Amazon Honor System.  Use your credit
card and make a payment as small as one dollar, or up to $50.
<p>
If you wish to donate more than $50, or you wish to send a personal check,
please visit the
<?php print "<a href=credits.php?$langLinkStr>";
?>Credits</a> page and send an email to one or more of the individual
developers.
