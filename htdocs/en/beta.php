<p>
Warning: the following version of Audacity is beta quality!
It contains dozens of new features, including a new toolbar,
automatic resampling, and support for 32-bit samples, but it probably
also contains new bugs.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in experimenting with the new features, we
encourage you to download this version and give it a try.
If you do, please send us feedback.  Let us know what works,
what doesn't, and what new features you would like to see.
You can have this version and Audacity 1.0 on your computer at
the same time.

<p>
Note:
This version cannot read or write project files saved by Audacity 1.0
or older.  It uses a new XML-based project file format.
