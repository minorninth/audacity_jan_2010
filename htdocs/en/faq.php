1. Is Audacity really free?  Why?<br>

</b></font>

<p>

Yes, in almost all senses.  Audacity is not only distributed
free of charge, but you are also free to do almost anything
you want with it.
<p>
Audacity is distributed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"
>General Public License (GPL)</a>.
You are free to use this program for personal or commercial
purposes.  You are also free to give it away or sell it.
The source code to this program is freely available on the
web, and you are free to modify it for your own use, however
any changes you make must also be distributed under the GPL.
<p>
Audacity was build using wxWidgets, a software library which
is released under the less-restrictive LGPL.  
For more information, please visit 
<a href="http://wxwidgets.org/">wxwidgets.org</a>.
<p>
The authors of Audacity decided to release it under the GPL
for many reasons.  Some of us do it out of generosity.
Some of us do it for moral reasons, because we feel that
all software should be free, while others of us believe that
there is a need for both free and commercial software in the
world.
<p>
One reason Audacity is free is so that it will be more popular.
Many of us would rather see a million people happily using
Audacity for free than have a thousand people pay us.
Most users are more friendly when they get something for free.

<p>
Yet another reason is that it encourages collaboration.  If Audacity
was shareware, it is unlikely that dozens of people around the
world would have contributed code, bug fixes, documentation,
and graphics.

2. Who Developed Audacity?<br>
</b></font>

<p>

Audacity was started in the fall of 1999
by Dominic Mazzoni while he was a graduate
student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
He was working on a research project with his advisor, Professor
Roger Dannenberg, and they needed a tool that would let them
visualize audio analysis algorithms.  Over time, this program
developed into a general audio editor, and other people started
helping out.
<p>
Today, Audacity is developed using Sourceforge, an online site
that allows people around the world to collaborate on free
software projects.  See <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net"
>sourceforge.net</a> for more information.
Dozens of people have contributed to
Audacity, and progress is continually accelerating.

3. How can I help to improve Audacity?<br>
</b></font>

Find bugs and tell us about them.
Write code.  Translate it into your language.  Draw graphics.
Join the Audacity-Users mailing list.  Send us money.
<p>
Please see our new <?php print "<a href=donatetime.php?$langLinkStr>"; ?>Donation</a>
page for more details on how you can help out.
<p>

<a name="g4"></a>
<font size=+1><b>
4. I found a bug!  Now what?<br>
</b></font>
<p>

The most important thing when reporting a bug is to be
as specific as possible.  Give us enough information that
we can reproduce the bug ourselves, otherwise it's unlikely
that we'll be able to fix it.  Send bug reports to
<a href="mailto:audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net">
&lt;audacity-help@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;</a>.
<br><font size=-1><?php print "$listPrivacyStr"; ?></font>
<p>
Be sure to let us know what operating system you run
(such as Windows 98, MacOS 9.1, RedHat Linux 7.1, etc.)
and any other information about your computer that you
think might be relevant.
<p>
Then, can you reproduce the bug?  If it happens consistently,
tell us the exact sequence of events which causes the bug to
occur.  If you get an error message, make sure you send us
the exact text of the error message.
<p>

We want to squash all of the bugs!  Thanks for taking the time to
help us track them down.

<font size=+1><b>
1. Windows: What do I do with the .exe file?<br>
</b></font>

<p>From the browser, select the option to "Run from current
location".  This launches the Audacity setup program, which will install the
Audacity program files and create an entry in the start menu.
<p>
If you already downloaded the file, just double-click on it to
start the installer.
<p>
If you prefer not to use the Installer program, you can also
download Audacity as a ZIP file, which you can decompress
using WinZip.

<p>
<a name="i2"></a>
<font size=+1><b>
2. Windows: How do I uninstall Audacity?<br>
</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>Audacity can be uninstalled by opening
Add/Remove Programs in
the Control Panel.  Select "Audacity" from the list and
click the button
"Add/Remove".
This launches the Audacity uninstall program.

<p>
<a name="i3"></a> <font size=+1><b> 3. Mac: What do I do with
the .sit file?<br> </b></font>

<p>
You need a recent version of StuffIt Expander.  StuffIt Expander
comes with all Macintoshes and is usually configured by default
with all Mac web browsers.  If Audacity does not decompress
automatically, drag "audacity.sit" to StuffIt Expander to decompress
it.
<p>
There is no need to install Audacity.  Just drag the Audacity
folder to your Applications folder, or wherever else you would
like to put it.  To uninstall, just drag the entire folder to
the trash.

4. Unix: Why do I get failed dependencies when installing from the RPM?
<br></b></font>

<p><font size=+0>First, ensure that the wxGTK is installed; a link can be found
from our Linux page - http://audacity.sourceforge.net/linux.html. If the RPM
still fails to install, this is an unresolved issue.  Simply install the RPM
using the flag --nodeps.</font>

<p>
<a name="i5"></a>
<font size=+1><b>

5. Unix: Why do I get an error while loading
	the shared library libwx_gtk.so?<br></b></font>

<p><font size=+0>This could be one of two problems:
<br>- If you installed the wxWindows RPM, be sure to run "ldconfig" (as
root) so your system knows about the new library.

<br><br>- If you installed wxWidgets
from source, it may have been installed in /usr/local, but /usr/local/lib may
not be in your library path. Add /usr/local/lib to the file "/etc/ld.so.conf"
and then run "ldconfig". You may also want to add "/usr/local/bin" to your path,
so that programs can find the "wx-config" utility.<br>

1. How do I mix two tracks together?
</b></font>
<p>

Audacity mixes automatically.  All you have to do is
import two tracks into the same project, which you can
do using the "Import Audio" command in the Project
menu, or simply by dragging the two audio files to
Audacity.  When you press the record button, Audacity
generates a new track automatically, also.

<p>

In order to save your mix, you can either Export the
project, which will automatically mix all of your
tracks together, or you can select your tracks and
use the "Quick Mix" command in the Project menu.

<font size=+1><b>
2. Can I remove the vocals from a recording?
</b></font>
<p>

With some stereo recordings, it is possible to remove the vocals
because of the way in which the recording was mixed at the studio.
Often, the vocals are placed in the exact center of the recording,
while all other instruments are slightly off-center.  If you
subtract the right channel from the left channel, the vocals get
completely canceled out, leaving only the other instruments.
<p>

<b>This only works on some recordings!</b>
<p>
To attempt this in Audacity, import a stereo recording, then
click on the track pop-up menu (the little down-arrow next to
the name of the track) and select "Split Stereo Track".
Now select the lower track (the right channel) and use the
"Invert" effect (from the Effect menu).  Finally, use the
track pop-up menus to make both channels Mono channels,
and then mix them together using Quick Mix.  If you're lucky,
the vocals will be gone.

<font size=+1><b>
3. When I try to record harmonies with myself,
              why are the two tracks out of sync?
</b></font>
<p>
This is normal and it happens because there is a small delay
between when Audacity starts playing sound and when it actually
reaches your speaker.  Audacity does not automatically try to
correct for this delay, and you must do it manually.
<p>
To correct this delay, use the
Time Shift tool to slide
one of the tracks over until they line up.  Note that you can
use the tool while you are listening to the recording.

<p>

<font size=+1><b>
4. Why doesn't Audacity ship with an MP3 encoder?
</b></font>
<p>

Unfortunately, the algorithm to encode or create MP3 files
is patented, and <b>Audacity</b> would not be able to
include an MP3 exporting algorithm without either
charging a fee or violating the law in many countries.
<p>
As a compromise, Audacity comes with the ability to use
other MP3 encoders, which you must download separately.
It is up to you to make sure you are in compliance with
any licensing restrictions imposed by MP3 encoders.
<p>
For more information, see the page on Exporting MP3 files in
our Online Help.

<p>

<font size=+1><b>
5. Can I record RealAudio or other streaming audio?
</b></font>
</p><p>

Not automatically.  Most streaming audio, including most music delivered to
the RealOne Player, Windows Media Player, and Quicktime, is specifically
designed to prevent you from recording it.
</p><p>
Still, it's almost always still possible to record anything your computer
can play by looping your sound-out jack to your sound-in/microphone jack
on your computer's sound card.
</p><p>
Use a 1/8 inch stereo mini to 1/8 inch stereo mini cable.  Connect one end
to the sound-out jack on your computer or sound card (where you would
plug speakers or headphones - it's often colored green).  Connect the other
end to the microphone or line-in jack (it's often colored red).
</p><p>
Now Audacity can record anything your computer plays.  Press Record
in Audacity, and then press Play in your streaming audio program.
</p><p>

<a name="a6"></a>
<font size=+1><b>
6. Help! I press Record, but all I get is silence!
</b></font>
</p><p>
Audacity records from the default input source that is selected by
your operating system.  If you have multiple input sources (such as
a built-in microphone, an external microphone, line-in jack, or an
audio CD) you have to select one of these to record from.  If you are
trying to record from a microphone, for example, but your input source
is set to "line in", then Audacity will just record silence.
</p><p>
If you use Windows, you can set the input source by right-clicking
on the volume icon in your tool tray (in the lower-right corner of
your screen).
</p><p>
If you use Mac OS 9, use the Sound control panel.  On Mac OS X, use
the Sound panel in the System Preferences (there's an Input tab if you
have 10.2 or higher).
</p><p>
On Linux, use a mixer like "xmixer" or "kmix".
</p><p>

7. How do I split a single file into multiple tracks?
</b></font>
</p><p>
Sometimes you might end up with a recording of multiple songs that are
in a single file.  If you want to burn these songs onto a CD as separate
tracks, you need to create a separate file for each song.
</p><p>
There are lots of ways to split a recording into multiple tracks using
Audacity.  Here are a few methods you can try:
</p><p>
Method 1: Export Selection
</p><ul>
<li>Select the region of audio corresponding to the first track.
</li><li>Choose "Export Selection as WAV" from the File menu, and save it to
    disk.
</li><li>Continue for all remaining tracks.
</li></ul>
<p>
Method 2: Delete and Undo
</p><ul>
<li>Delete everything <i>except</i> for the first track.
</li><li>Choose "Export as WAV" from the File menu, and save the first track
    to disk.
</li><li>Select "Undo" from the Edit menu.  Keep undo-ing until you have the rest
    of your audio back.  (Audacity has unlimited undo.)
</li><li>Continue for all remaining tracks.
</li></ul>
<p>
Method 3: Split and Export
</p><ul>
<li>Select what you would like to be the first track.
</li><li>Choose "Split" from the Edit menu, which moves the selection into
    a separate track within Audacity.
</li><li>Keep doing this until all of the songs are in separate tracks.
    Don't forget that you can Undo at any point if you make a mistake.
</li><li>Now go back through and use "Export Selection as WAV" to export each
    track to a separate file.  To quickly select each track, click on its
    label (anywhere in the area to the left of the waveform, underneath
    the title).
</li></ul>
<p>

<font size=+1><b>
8. How do I get songs from an audio CD?
</b></font>
</p><p>
Audacity does not extract songs from audio CDs.  You need to use a
"ripper" program for this.
</p><p>
For Windows, we recommend <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">CDex</a>.
</p><p>
For Mac OS (9 and X), we recommend Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>.
</p><p>
For Linux, try <a href="http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/">Paranoia</a>.
