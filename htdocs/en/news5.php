<p>
Note that Audacity 1.1.3 will not read project files saved by
any other version of Audacity, so you may not want to try this
version if you have project files you are still working on.
Export your audio as WAV or AIFF first if you want to open it in this
new version.
</p>

<p>
The plan is for our next release to be a stable version of Audacity
intended for all users.
