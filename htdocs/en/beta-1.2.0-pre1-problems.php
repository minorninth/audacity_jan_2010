<h2>Known Problems</h2>

<p>
The following are known bugs in Audacity 1.2.0-pre1:
</p>

<ul>
<li>VST plugin loading has been disabled in this release while we work out
potential licensing issues.  We plan to include VST support again in the
Audacity 1.2.0 final release.</li>

<li>The user's manual is still under construction.  Updates for Audacity 1.2
are about 75% complete.  There may be some missing or incomplete pages.</li>

<li>Audacity may crash if audio is edited while the program is playing or
recording.</li>

<li>(MacOS X only?) If you select Quit, but then cancel the Quit operation,
then the Quit and Preferences commands stop working.</li>

<li>Some imported MP3 files may have pops or clicks caused by clipping.</li>

<li>The volume sliders in the mixer toolbar may reset the volume whenever the
program starts, on some systems.</li>

<li>Audacity can import and display MIDI files, but they cannot be played or
edited.</li>

<li>Audacity crashes when trying to convert to a sample rate more than 12
times faster or slower than the original rate.</li>

<li>Recording in full duplex (play existing tracks while recording) on some
Linux systems causes the recording to sound slowed-down.</li>

<li>MacOS X only:  The Find Zero Crossings command has "Command-Z" listed as
the shortcut, but the actual shortcut is "Z".  The shortcuts for "Online Help"
and "Open" conflict.</li>

<li>MacOS X only: For audio with zero amplitude, Audacity may display nothing
(instead of thin straight line).</li>
</ul>
