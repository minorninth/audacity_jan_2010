<?php BoxTop('November 11, 2002: Version 1.1.1 released.'); ?>

<p>
Version 1.1.1 is now available.
</p>

<p>
We still recommend Audacity 1.0 for most new and beginning users.  Audacity
1.0.0 is simple, stable and has complete documentation.
</p>

<p>
More advanced users may be interested in trying out Audacity 1.1.1, which
has many new features, but is still under development and is only
beta-quality.  The documentation for version 1.1.1 may not be complete.
</p>

<p>
Audacity 1.1.1 has much improved support for Mac OS X, and for foreign
languages.  Users who use Mac OS X or who wish to use Audacity in
Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish,
Russian, Slovenian, or Spanish should download Audacity 1.1.1.
</p>

<p>
You can find version 1.1.1 on our 
<?php print "<a href=beta.php?$langLinkStr>"; ?>Beta Versions</a> page.
