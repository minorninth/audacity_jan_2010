Go to the <?php print "<a href=beta.php?$langLinkStr>"; ?>Beta Versions</a> page
to download.
Windows users who are currently using a beta version (1.1.0 or 1.1.1) should
upgrade to this version to fix a serious problem.  All other users do not
need to upgrade.

<?php BoxTop('December 3, 2002: Version 1.1.1 update'); ?>

<p>
In-progress documentation for version 1.1.1 is now available to browse
online.  It will be available as a separate download when it is finished.

<p>
We are aware that there is a serious problem in version 1.1.1 (beta)
for Windows.  Selecting anything from a track pop-up menu will crash
the program.  We will be releasing version 1.1.2 for Windows only
within a few days to address this problem.  (This only affects the pop-up
menu in the track's label - all other menus function correctly - and
this only affects the Microsoft Windows version of Audacity 1.1.1.)
</p>

<p>
For Unix users, a new source tarball has been released, 1.1.1-3, which
fixes problems compiling with wxGTK 2.2.9.  We hope to have a version
which compiles on RedHat 8 with no modifications soon.

<?php BoxTop('November 11, 2002: Version 1.1.1 released.'); ?>

<p>
Version 1.1.1 is now available.
</p>

<p>
We still recommend Audacity 1.0 for most new and beginning users.  Audacity
1.0.0 is simple, stable and has complete documentation.
</p>

<p>
More advanced users may be interested in trying out Audacity 1.1.1, which
has many new features, but is still under development and is only
beta-quality.  The documentation for version 1.1.1 may not be complete.
</p>

<p>
Audacity 1.1.1 has much improved support for Mac OS X, and for foreign
languages.  Users who use Mac OS X or who wish to use Audacity in
Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish,
Russian, Slovenian, or Spanish should download Audacity 1.1.1.
</p>

<p>
You can find version 1.1.1 on our 
<?php print "<a href=beta.php?$langLinkStr>"; ?>Beta Versions</a> page.

<?php BoxTop('June 5, 2002: Versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 released!'); ?>

<p>
The Audacity Development Team is happy to announce the simultaneous
release of versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.0.0 is the final, stable version of the original Audacity.
It is a good, simple audio editor suitable for recording, mixing, and
editing ordinary tracks of CD-quality audio, on many platforms including
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.1.0 is the first beta release of the next version of Audacity,
which includes support for higher-quality audio, more audio file formats,
more effects, more editing functions, an improved user interface, and
support for foreign languages.  Though this version has many new and useful
features, some of these features are still under development and they have
not been tested as much, and there may have problems.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to have both versions of Audacity on your computer
at the same time.
