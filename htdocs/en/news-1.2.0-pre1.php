<p>
Audacity 1.2.0-pre1 is a public test release of the free Audacity sound
editor.  The purpose of this release is to allow users to preview and
test the new features that will appear in our next stable version 1.2.0,
which we hope to release next month.
</p>

<p>
This release adds professional quality audio processing, and major new
features such as the ability to speed up, slow down, and alter the pitch of a
track.  It is the first release that can open project files saved in the older
Audacity 1.0 format as well as the new XML format used by Audacity 1.1 and
higher.  Audacity 1.2.0-pre1 fixes many bugs from the last beta release.
</p>

complete release notes and download links.
</p>

<p>
Note: VST plugin loading has been disabled in Audacity 1.2.0-pre1 while we
work out potential licensing issues.  We hope to resolve any conflicts in time
to include VST support in the Audacity 1.2.0 final release.
