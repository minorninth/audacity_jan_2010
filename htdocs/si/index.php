<?php BoxTop('November 11, 2002: Version 1.1.1 released.'); ?>

<p>
Version 1.1.1 is now available.
</p>

<p>
We still recommend Audacity 1.0 for most new and beginning users.  Audacity
1.0.0 is simple, stable and has complete documentation.
</p>

<p>
More advanced users may be interested in trying out Audacity 1.1.1, which
has many new features, but is still under development and is only
beta-quality.  The documentation for version 1.1.1 may not be complete.
</p>

<p>
Audacity 1.1.1 has much improved support for Mac OS X, and for foreign
languages.  Users who use Mac OS X or who wish to use Audacity in
Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish,
Russian, Slovenian, or Spanish should download Audacity 1.1.1.
</p>

<p>
You can find version 1.1.1 on our 
<?php print "<a href=beta.php?$langLinkStr>"; ?>Beta Versions</a> page.

<p>
The Audacity Development Team is happy to announce the simultaneous
release of versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.0.0 is the final, stable version of the original Audacity.
It is a good, simple audio editor suitable for recording, mixing, and
editing ordinary tracks of CD-quality audio, on many platforms including
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.1.0 is the first beta release of the next version of Audacity,
which includes support for higher-quality audio, more audio file formats,
more effects, more editing functions, an improved user interface, and
support for foreign languages.  Though this version has many new and useful
features, some of these features are still under development and they have
not been tested as much, and there may have problems.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to have both versions of Audacity on your computer
at the same time.
