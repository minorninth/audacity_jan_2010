Known bugs in Audacity 1.1.1:

  * Do not run the Benchmark command on Windows - it may crash.
    It is not a useful feature for most users - it is intended
    for developers to judge the speed of the program on different
    computers and operating systems.

  * Mac OS X: some audio may be lost if you hold the mouse button
    for too long over a menu while recording.  Try to leave Audacity
    alone while recording for best results.
