Following are some bugs which may not have been entered
into bugzilla yet.  Some of these may have been fixed,
too...people should try to reproduce them...

* MAD imports values out of -1.0...1.0 range...need to clip

* Program crashes if gPrefs can't be created (Linux)...

* Plot Spectrum doesn't obey the selection - it grabs
  all tracks (or the last track?), not the selected track

* Full duplex does not work correctly on Audacity 1.1 on
  Linux.  Sounds recorded appear to be "down an octave".

* Exporting using LAME does incorrect sample rate,
  or incorrect # of channels?  Maybe only with certain
  versions of LAME?

* When using a Nyquist plugin on a track whose sample rate
  differs from the project rate, the selection changes
  incorrectly, probably reflecting the project rate rather
  than the track rate.

* Exporting tracks with envelopes and an offset can result
  in different WAV output than what you see on the screen in
  the editor.  (See email from Mike Tyson).

* In the input/output gain toolbar the pixmaps are in wrong places:
the output has microphone pixmap.  (REALLY???)

* Time scrollbar < and > buttons do not work after 16 (say) zoom steps,
  e.g., with projects larger than 30 minutes of audio.

* After cut, the view is not at the cut point (if selection was
  4 seconds, the view is 4 seconds forward from the cut point).

* A toolbar goes slightly over the transport toolbar when they
  are arranged automatically to the same row. (In wxGTK/Linux.)

* mixer toolbar has no default device written on the menu, but
  clearly some mixer channel is controlled;

* even the play region is completely visible, the display jumps to
  left -- it jumps so that the start of the play region is on the left
  edge of display;

* plot spectrum does not work if the selection is too small;

* multitool slide stops when the pointer moves over the track labels;

* multitool is still not "polished" - the handles on the left and
  right should line up better

* Drawing tool uses Alt modifier but that does not work in GNome
  (or with other window managers) - there should be another key
  sequence that's more likely to be supported

* "Drag the label vertically to change the order of the tracks"
  performs "select all". Two operations in one.  (It shouldn't
  do this, right?)

* very narrow selection is not always drawn; very narrow
  selections should be one pixel wide if samples/pixel value
  is high

* very narrow selection with high samples/pixel value
  causes problems in grabbing and dragging the selection edges

* zoom at low samples/pixel value; make a selection; zoom-out;
  now adjust an edge of the selection by one pixel; then
  adjust the edge to its original pixel location; now the
  selection differs from the original selection

* beat finder (nyquist script) caused core dump
  (I can't reproduce this...can someone send me a gdb trace?)

* libsamplerate crashes if you try to change the rate by
  more than a factor of 12.  We need to handle this case if
  the user selects a track with, say, 71 Hz when the project
  is 44100 Hz.
