Following are some bugs which may not have been entered
into bugzilla yet.  Some of these may have been fixed,
too...people should try to reproduce them...

Last reviewed 22/Jun/2003.

---------

* MAD imports values out of -1.0...1.0 range...need to clip

* Program crashes if gPrefs can't be created (Linux)...

* Full duplex does not work correctly on Audacity 1.1 on
  Linux.  Sounds recorded appear to be "down an octave".

* Exporting using LAME does incorrect sample rate,
  or incorrect # of channels?  Maybe only with certain
  versions of LAME?

* mixer toolbar has no default device written on the menu, but
  clearly some mixer channel is controlled;

* even the play region is completely visible, the display jumps to
  left -- it jumps so that the start of the play region is on the left
  edge of display; [Don't understand.  Please explain again].

* plot spectrum does not work if the selection is too small;
  [22/Jun/03, still present.]

* Plot Spectrum doesn't obey the selection - it grabs
  all tracks (or the last track?), not the selected track [Update:
  22/Jun/03, Plot Spectrum IS selection sensitive, however 
  pure-tones (produced using generate) have less sharp spectra 
  than I would expect, so possibly something still needs looking at 
  here, e.g. whether plot-spectrum is sampling noise as well
  as the desired data.  JKC]

* Drawing tool uses Alt modifier but that does not work in GNome
  (or with other window managers) - there should be another key
  sequence that's more likely to be supported

* very narrow selection is not always drawn; very narrow
  selections should be one pixel wide if samples/pixel value
  is high. [22/Jun/03, still present]

* libsamplerate crashes if you try to change the rate by
  more than a factor of 12.  We need to handle this case if
  the user selects a track with, say, 71 Hz when the project
  is 44100 Hz. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Move these to ToDo (for Post 1.2.0)?:
=====================================
* zoom at low samples/pixel value; make a selection; zoom-out;
  now adjust an edge of the selection by one pixel; then
  adjust the edge to its original pixel location; now the
  selection differs from the original selection. --Not really
  a bug so much as a request for enhanced behaviour.  This 
  would be part of a more general move to store positions as 
  float time values, only rounding down to pixels when drawing 
  to the screen.  Such a feature would improve functionality 
  in many other instances where zoom level is changed.--

* Very narrow selection with high samples/pixel value
  causes problems in grabbing and dragging the selection edges.
  -- Details:  The selection shown on the wavetrack is rounded to
  the nearest boundary between samples.  To drag the selection 
  edge you must look at the sample as shown by the ruler.
  This will cease to be a problem if we add a new feature that 
  shows both sample selection and the ruler's time selection
  (using different shading perhaps, or by changing the appearance
  of the selcted samples) on the wave track.--

* multitool slide stops when the pointer moves over the track labels;
  --Request for Enhancement, not a bug.--

* "Drag the label vertically to change the order of the tracks"
  performs "select all". Two operations in one.  (It shouldn't
  do this, right?)
  --Request for Enhancement, not a bug.--


------------------------------

Non Issues?
===========
* In the input/output gain toolbar the pixmaps are in wrong places:
  the output has microphone pixmap.  --REALLY???--

* Exporting tracks with envelopes and an offset can result
  in different WAV output than what you see on the screen in
  the editor.  See email from Mike Tyson. --Please GIVE DATE
  of this e-mail so that can follow up the detailed description--

* A toolbar goes slightly over the transport toolbar when they
  are arranged automatically to the same row.  In wxGTK/Linux.
  --Please post a screenshot to the developer list showing the 
  problem, for attention JKC.--

* beat finder (nyquist script) caused core dump
  --I can't reproduce this...can someone send me a gdb trace?,
  for attention DM.  Nyquist has had a major overhaul since this
  bug was first posted.--
  
------------------------------

Resolved:
=========
* When using a Nyquist plugin on a track whose sample rate
  differs from the project rate, the selection changes
  incorrectly, probably reflecting the project rate rather
  than the track rate. [Fixed 19/Apr/03]

* multitool is still not "polished" - the handles on the left and
  right should line up better [Fixed 15/Jun/03]

* Time scrollbar < and > buttons do not work after 16 (say) zoom steps,
  e.g., with projects larger than 30 minutes of audio. [Works for me
  under Win98 JKC]

* After cut, the view is not at the cut point (if selection was
  4 seconds, the view is 4 seconds forward from the cut point). [Works
  for me under Win98 JKC]
