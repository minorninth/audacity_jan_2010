Hi,
I'm sending you the message catalog for the Bulgarian localization. Hopefully everything is Ok - I believe I have checked all dialog boxes.

Some of the fonts used in the GUI have no Cyrillic letters though, so some of the the Bulgarian labels (and the Russian ones) are unreadable - they are displayed in the Western European code page. (I work under Win XP). The status line is one example, and the labels at the left side of a track window are another.
