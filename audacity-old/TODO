This is not an absolute list, but rather a sketchpad for keeping ideas,
refining them, critiquing them, and perhaps implementing them. But it's
better to write an idea down and throw it away than to have a good idea
and never remember it again.

META::
- library reorganization


-----------------------------------------------------------
1.0 (required):
-----------------------------------------------------------

UI::
- Make Alt-F select the File menu on Windows
- Make "Exit program upon closing last window" an option
  in the Preferences.  (The alternative would be to create
  a new empty project when you close the last window.)
- When the user exports, for example, a WAV file, but
  they don't type the WAV extension, it should add it
  for them.  (If they type a DIFFERENT extension, it
  should leave it alone.)
- better ruler, both for time (horizontally) and magnitude/pitch (vertical)
- add "trim" (= opposite of delete -- delete all but selection)
- invert selection (for now, until we allow discontiguous selections,
                    this should mean two options: select up to selection,
                    and select after selection)
- legend for pitch and spectrum
- resampling
- Out of disk space checks
- History window, with ability to throw away undo information to
  save disk space
- Autoscrolling during playback

Audio I/O::
- import/export ogg vorbis everywhere
- move to portaudio (www.portaudio.com)

Effects::
- Smart Mix (like Quick Mix but guarantees no clipping)
- Cross-fade (smooth between two tracks)
- Compressor/Limiter/Expander
- Native port of Freeverb (ideally optimized)

Low level issues:
- Automatic approximate resampling, if two tracks are at
  different sample rates but are supposed to be played
  together

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.0 (desired):
-----------------------------------------------------------

UI::
- ability to drag tracks instead of move down, move down, move down
- "Fit in window" also works vertically
- auto-fit on open (configurable?)
- right-click capabilities
- loop over a small segment
- better adaptation to different font sizes (sizers)
- move to lossless compression (FLAC?) for internal representation
- Pan control for each track

Audio I/O::
- move to libsndfile (or something like it)?
  ideally support many more sound file formats

Effects::
- Noise reduction (this is the most requested effect)

Low level issues::
- Make projects one big file

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.2 (planned):
-----------------------------------------------------------

UI::
- make colors configurable
- allow labels to contain selections, which would be activated by clicking
  on the label
- invert selection (i.e. allow discontiguous selection)

New features::
- visualization window: VU meters, equalizer, continuous waveform, oscilloscope
- EQ

Low level issues::
- support more sample sizes, allow conversion
- support multi-track I/O
- support an arbitrary number of channels
- Make projects one big file
