<a name="import"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Import...
</b></font>

<p>
This command is used to import audio from a standard audio format into
your project.  Use this command if you already have a couple of tracks,
and you want to add another track to the same document, maybe to mix
them together.

<a name="importraw"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Import Raw Data...
</b></font>

<p>This menu command allows you to open a file in virtually any
format, as long as it is not compressed.  When you select the
file, Audacity will look through it and try to guess its format.
It will guess correctly about 90% of the time, so you can try just
pressing "OK" and listening to it.  If it is not correct, however,
you can use the dialog presented to try all of the different
parameters.
<p>
At the beginning of your imported track(s), you may notice a little
bit of noise.  This is probably the file's header, which Audacity
was not able to parse.  Just zoom in and select the noise with the
<a href="toolbar.htm#selection">Selection Tool</a>, and then
choose <a href="menu2.htm#delete">Delete</a>.

<a name="quickmix"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Quick Mix
</b></font>

<p>This command mixes all of the selected tracks down to one or two
tracks.  The channel of a track being mixed affects whether it
will be mixed into the left channel of the resulting track(s),
the right channel, or both (mono).  For example, if you have
four tracks:

<ul>
<li> Track 1: left channel
<li> Track 2: left channel
<li> Track 3: right channel
<li> Track 4: mono channel
</ul>

and you select them all and perform a Quick Mix, you will end up
with two tracks: the first will contain a mix of tracks 1, 2, and 4
(the new left channel) and the other will contain a mix of tracks
3 and 4 (the new right channel).

<p>

Your tracks are implicitly mixed whenever you hit the
<a href="toolbar.htm#play">Play</a> 
button and whenever you select 
<a href="menu1.htm#export">Export</a>.

<a name="aligntogether"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Align Tracks Together
</b></font>

<p>If you select multiple tracks, this command adjusts their time offset
so that they start at the same time.  It adjusts their starting time
to the average of all of the tracks' original starting times.
To adjust the time offset of a track, use the 
<a href="toolbar.htm#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool.

<a name="alignzero"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Align with Zero
</b></font>

<p>If you select multiple tracks, this command resets their time offset
to zero.
To adjust the time offset of a track, use the 
<a href="toolbar.htm">Time Shift</a> tool.

<a name="newaudiotrack"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
New Audio Track
</b></font>

<p>This creates a new empty audio track.  This command is rarely needed,
since importing, recording, and mixing automatically create new tracks
as needed.  But you can use this to cut or copy data from an existing
track and paste it into a blank track.

<a name="newlabeltrack"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
New Label Track
</b></font>

<p>This creates a new Label track, which can be very useful for
textual annotation.  See the discussion on 
<a name="tracks.htm#label">Label tracks</a> for more information
on how to use label tracks.

<a name="remove"></a>
<p><font size=+0><b>
Remove Track(s)
</b></font>

<p>This command removes the selected track or tracks from the project.
Even if only part of a track is selected, the entire track is removed.
You can also delete a track by clicking the X in its upper-left corner.
To cut out only part of the audio in a track, use
<a href="menu1.htm#delete">Delete</a> or 
<a href="menu1.htm#silence">Silence</a>.
