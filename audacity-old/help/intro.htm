<h2>What can you do with <font color="#000099">Audacity</font>?</h2>

<font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a program that lets you
manipulate digital audio
waveforms. In addition to letting you record sounds directly from
within the program, it imports many sound file formats, including WAV,
AIFF, AU, IRCAM, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis.  It supports all common editing
operations such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, plus it will mix tracks and
let you apply plug-in effects to any part of a sound. It also has a
built-in amplitude envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode
and a frequency analysis window for audio analysis applications.

<h2>What can't you do with <font color="#000099">Audacity</font>?</h2>

Although <font color="#000099">Audacity</font> is a very powerful
audio editor that lets you work with an unlimited tracks of virtually
unlimited size, it cannot do everything:

<ul>
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
cannot record more than two channels at once.  It does
not support any special hardware, but just works with your system's
default audio device.
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> opens MIDI files,
but it is not a MIDI editor, and its
    MIDI features are extremely limited.
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> cannot resample
audio to different sample rates (yet).
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> currently only
works with 16-bit quality audio (so far - 
    support for higher quality audio is planned).
<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font> cannot export MP3 files (yet).
</ul>
