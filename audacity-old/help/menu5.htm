<h2>
What are effects?
</h2>

Effects are transformations that are applied to audio to change its
sound.  Audacity contains a few built-in effects which do very basic
operations such as changing the amplitude, fading in and out, and
echoing.  To apply an effect, select a region of audio or select
an entire track, and then select the name of the effect in the Effect
menu.  Most effects present a dialog box where you can choose the
parameters of the effect.  If you don't like how the effect sounds,
you can always <a href="menu2.htm#undo">Undo</a>.

<h2>
Plug-in effects
</h2>

Instead of trying to provide you with a complete set of effects,
Audacity supports plug-in effects in the Cubase VST format.
There are hundreds of free, shareware, and commercial VST plug-ins
available to do everything from reverb and chorus effects to
noise reduction and filtering.  A simple web search will get you
started in the right direction, or you can use the links from
Audacity's web page.
<p>
To use a Cubase plug-in in Audacity, place the plug-ins in a directory
(folder) called VST in your Audacity directory.  If you don't already
have a directory called VST, create one.  The next time you start
Audacity, those plug-ins will appear in your Effect menu.
<p>
Unfortunately, plug-ins are not supported on Unix systems yet.
If you are a Linux developer and would like to help, let us know!
