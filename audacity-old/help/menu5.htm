Effect Menu
</font>

<p>The commands in this menu apply effects to your audio tracks.
A small number of built-in effects come with Audacity, however on
Windows and Macintosh systems, you can expand Audacity's capabilities
using VST plug-ins.  (On Linux, LADSPA support is coming soon...)

<p>To apply an effect, simply select part or all of the tracks you want
to modify, and select the effect from the menu.  Titles which end in
an ellipsis (...) will bring up a dialog asking you for more parameters.

<p>To use a VST plug-in effect, put the effect in the directory (folder)
called "VST", which should be in the same directory where Audacity
resides.  If there is no directory called VST, create one.  The next
time you launch Audacity, any plug-ins you added will appear in the
Effect menu.
