<h2>
Audacity Project format (AUP)
</h2>
Audacity projects are stored in an AUP file, which is a format that
has been highly optimized for Audacity so that it can open and save
projects extremely quickly.  In order to achieve this speed, Audacity
breaks larger audio files into several smaller pieces and stores these
pieces in a directory with a similar name as the project.
For example, if you name a project "chanson", then Audacity will create a
project file called <tt>chanson.aup</tt> which stores the general
information about your project, and it will store your audio in several
files inside a directory called <tt>chanson_data</tt>.
The Audacity Project format is not compatible with any other audio
programs, so when you are finished working on a project and you
want to be able to edit the audio in another program, select
<a href="#export">Export</a>.

<a name="wav"></a>
<h2>
WAV (Windows Wave format)
</h2>
This is the default uncompressed audio format on Windows, and is supported
on almost all computer systems.  Audacity can read and write this format.

<a name="aiff"></a>
<h2>
AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)
</h2>
This is the default uncompressed audio format on the Macintosh, and it
is supported by most computer systems, but it is not quite as common as
the WAV format.  Audacity can read and write this format.

<a name="au"></a>
<h2>
Sun Au / NeXT
</h2>
This is the default audio format on Sun and NeXT computers, and it is
usually very slightly compressed, so it is not a very high quality
format.  This format was one of the first audio formats supported by
Web browsers, and it is still often used for short sound effects where
quality is not as important.  Audacity can read this format.

<a name="ircam"></a>
<h2>
IRCAM (Institut de Recherce et Coordination Acoustique/Musique)
</h2>
This is a very general file format that is commonly used by
computer music researchers.  Audacity can read this format.

<a name="mp3"></a>
<h2>
MP3 (MPEG II, layer 3)
</h2>
This is a compressed audio format that is a very popular way to
store music.  It can compress audio by a factor of 10:1 with very
little degredation in quality.  Audacity can import this format,
but it cannot export it.

<a name="ogg"></a>
<h2>
Ogg Vorbis
</h2>
This is a new compressed audio format that was designed to be a free
alternative to MP3 files.  Ogg Vorbis files are not as common, but it produces
files of similar size as MP3 with very similar quality.
Audacity can import this format, but it cannot export it.
