<h1>
What makes Audacity unique?
</h1>

<ul>

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	is <it>free</it> and the source code is available
    under the GNU General Public License.

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	is <it>cross-platform</it> - it runs on Windows,
    MacOS, and many Unix platforms, including Linux.

<li>No limits on the number of tracks or the length of any track,
    except the size of your hard disk.

<li>Import almost anything: WAV, AIFF, Next/AU, IRCAM, MP3, and
    MIDI files are supported natively, but
	<font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	will also open just about any uncompressed sound file and
	automatically deduce the format (using the
	<a href="menu4.htm#importraw">Import Raw Data...</a>
    feature).

<li><font color="#000099">Audacity</font>
	acts like a <it>non-destructive editor</it>, providing
    multiple levels of undo, but it also writes changes made to the
	audio to disk, eliminating the need for complicated real-time
	processing.

<li>Label tracks allow you to annotate waveforms (for example,
    transcribing speech) and later export the waveforms to a text file.

<li>Powerful spectral features allow you to view waveforms as
    spectrograms or plot the power spectrum of any region of audio,
	and even export this data to a spreadsheet.

</ul>
