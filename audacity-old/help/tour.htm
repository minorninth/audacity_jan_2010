<p>Welcome to Audacity.  The purpose of this tour is to make new users
familiar with Audacity's interface.  When Audacity is first loaded,
the main window appears.  (It may look slightly different depending
on your operating system:)

<p align=center><img src="newmain.jpg" border=1><br><I>The Audacity main window, version 0.95</I>

<p>From this window all of Audacity's features can be accessed through
either the <a href="toolbar.htm">toolbar</a> or the <a
href="menus.htm">menus</a>.  The easiest way to learn about Audacity's
features is to open an existing audio file and manipulating it.  To do
this, pull down the File menu and select Open.  This brings up an
open-file dialog box, where you can open an audio file in any format
that Audacity supports.  These include wav files (.wav), aiff files
mp3 files (.mp3), and many more.  (See the 
<a href="fileformats.htm">file formats</a> page for more information
about what Audacity can read.)
If you have an audio file in some format that Audacity doesn't recognize,
you can still try to import it using the <a
href="menu4.htm#importraw">Import Raw Data</a> command.

<p> Once a file is opened or imported, the track(s) of that file
appears in the main area of the Audacity window, similar to this:
