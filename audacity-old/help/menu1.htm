<h1>
File Menu
</h1>

<a name="new"></a>
<h2>
New...
</h2>
Creates a new empty project window.

<a name="open"></a>
<h2>
Open...
</h2>
Selecting <i>Open</i> presents you with a dialog where you
can choose a file to open.  If the current project window
is empty, the new file will take over the current window,
otherwise a new project window will be opened.  The file formats
recognized by Audacity are
<a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#au">NeXT/AU</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#ircam">IRCAM</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#mp3">MP3</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a>,
<a href="fileformats.htm#midi">MIDI</a>,
and the Audacity Project file format 
(<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>).
In addition, Audacity can also attempt to open an audio file in
a different format, as long as it is uncompressed - to do this,
use the <a href="menu4.htm#importraw">Import Raw Data</a> command.

<a name="close"></a>
<h2>
Close
</h2>
Closes the current project window.

<a name="save"></a>
<h2>
Save
</h2>
Saves the current Audacity project (<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>)
file.  Audacity projects are <i>not</i> intended to be read by other
programs, but they are extremely fast to load and save within Audacity.
When you are finished working on a project and you want to be able to
use it in another program, select <a href="#export">Export</a> instead.
Note that most of the audio data for an Audacity project is not
stored in the <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a> file, but in a
directory (folder) with the same name as the project.  For example,
if you save a project as <tt>chanson.aup</tt>, there will be a directory
called <tt>chanson_data</tt> created to store the actual audio tracks
of the project.  For more information on the project file format,
see <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">the file formats page</a>.

<a name="saveas"></a>
<h2>
Save As...
</h2>
Saves the current Audacity project (<a href="fileformats.htm#aup">AUP</a>)
file.  Audacity projects are <i>not</i> intended to be read by other
programs, but they are extremely fast to load and save within Audacity.
When you are finished working on a project and you want to be able to
use it in another program, select <a href="#export">Export</a> instead.
For more information on the project file format,
see <a href="fileformats.htm#aup">the file formats page</a>.

<a name="export"></a>
<h2>
Export...
</h2>
Exports the current Audacity project as a standard audio file format
such as 
<a href="fileformats.htm#wav">WAV</a> or 
<a href="fileformats.htm#aiff">AIFF</a>.
Unfortunately, exporting to 
<a href="fileformats.htm#mp3">MP3</a> 
is not possible at this time,
so if you want to create an MP3 file, you must first export to
a WAV or AIFF file and then use a separate MP3 encoder.
<p>
If there are multiple tracks of the same channel in your project,
they will be automatically mixed in the exported data.  For more
information about mixing, see
<a href="menu4.htm#quickmix">Quick Mix</a>.
To export only a single track,
use <a href="#exportsel">Export Selection</a>.

<a name="exportsel"></a>
<h2>
Export Selection...
</h2>
This is the same as <a href="#export">Export</a>, but it only
exports the part of the project that is selected.  This is very
useful if you want to save a small clip from part of a track as
a separate file.

<a name="exportlabels"></a>
<h2>
Export Labels...
</h2>
If you have any <a href="tracks.htm#label">Label Tracks</a>, this
command will export them as a text file.  This feature is commonly
used in Speech Recognition research to annotate a speech utterance
and export the annotation to be later processed by another program.
To import these labels into a different project later, use the
<a href="menu4.htm#importlabels">Import Labels</a> command.

<a name="prefs"></a>
<h2>
Preferences
</h2>
Opens a dialog window that lets you configure Audacity.
For more information on the different preferences, see
the section on <a href="prefs.htm">Audacity Preferences</a>.

<a name="exit"></a>
<h2>
Exit/Quit
</h2>
Closes all project windows and exits Audacity.
